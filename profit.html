                    and Local Products </h1>
            </header>
            <p>
                At Stevco, we make it possible for your to raise funds
                through the sale of quality products, most of which are
                made locally by small businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our philosophy is simple. If you sell something people
                want to buy, they will buy more of it. This means it will
                be easier for your group to raise money.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, our programs all repeat very well, with many
                groups seeing a growth in profit from year to year. This is
                because of the quality of the items we choose.
            </p>

                <h2> Profit Scale </h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                We keep your profit simple. You'll earn between $5 and $7 per item, depending on how many items your
                group sells overall.
            </p>
            <p> Small groups can expect to make between $1,000 - $3,000 per sale, while larger groups like schools and
                sports leagues can easily make between $6,000 - $10,000.</p>
            <p>
                Smaller groups especially appreciate our no minimum free delivery policy.
