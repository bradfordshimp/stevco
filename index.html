            <p>
                Everyone knows that local is better. At Stevco, we help you offer
                local items in your school, sports, or group fundraiser.
                We do this by partnering with recognized local bakeries,
                coffee shops, and other small businesses.
            </p>
            <h3> Good Taste </h3>
            <p>
                While it's great to support local business, there are other
                benefits for your group. It all starts with taste. We choose
                items that we love, and we think you will too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Groups that choose our local fundraising brochures often see
                growth year over year, and people actually look forward to buying
                great local products.
            </p>
            <h3> A Fresh Idea </h3>
            <p> While some fundraising companies look to increase their bottom
                line by finding the cheapest products to sell, we offer a different
                approach. </p>
            <p> We think that quality is better than cutting corners. When
                customers are satisfied, it makes fundraising easier. That's
                why groups that work with us can make high profits while
                having happy customers.
