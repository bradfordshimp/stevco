            </header>
            <p>
                Since 1984, Stevco has been a family owned business committed to helping local organizations raise
                money.
                Over the years, we've gotten to
                know a lot of wonderful people who are community driven and who care about our children. This includes
                coaches, teachers, moms and dads who
                volunteer their time, small business owners, and so many more.
            </p>
            <p>
                We've always been proud to be part of the success of groups and organizations that are doing great
                things in
                our communities
                throughout Upstate New York.
            </p>
            <p>
                In recent years, we've been able to partner with local businesses, such as Leo's Bakery in East
                Rochester
                and Coffee Mania in Cortland,
                for our fundraising programs. This means that not only can we help local groups raise money, we can
                often do so by providing locally
                made goods for them to sell.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are proud of where we live, and the people who work hard to provide better education, sports, arts,
                recreation, travel and many more
                types of opportunities for our kids. Let's keep helping each other succeed.
            </p>

            </header>
            <p>
                We are a small, family owned business. Ernie and Anita Shimp started Stevco Enterprises in 1984. Over
                the years, their children and grandchildren have helped them in various ways. Currently, their son Brad
                helps run the business.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based in Clyde, Stevco is uniquely positioned to provide personal service to both the Rochester and
                Syracuse regions, as well as the Finger Lakes region. Because of our commitment to staying local, we
                provide a higher level of service than a
                company working with national products.
                This shows up in a lot of ways, but perhaps most importantly on delivery day. We bring the items
                ourselves at a specific time and help unload
                your pre-packaged boxes. You and your volunteers set up the boxes alphabetically by seller and simply
                hand them out to each family as they
                come to pick them up.
            </p>
            <p>
                We stock all of the product we sell, package it for you, and deliver it ourselves. This makes everything
                easier for you. We get your items to you on time. We have extra stock to handle loose ends and late
                orders. We don't have to a depend on an outside delivery company tractor trailer company will arrive
                to show up on time. We don't have to rely on anyone but ourselves to make sure your fundraiser is a
                success. And
                we're deeply commited to making sure it is.
