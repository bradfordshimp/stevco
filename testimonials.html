                    Stevco is an amazing company to work with. Not only do they offer quality products, they communicate
                    often, deliver the products on time, and are always available to answer questions. Stevco packages
                    everything by student name, which aids in the delivery of the products to the students. I highly
                    recommend working with Stevco for fundraising!

                    makes

                    Stevco does all the work all you have to do is collect the money. There is no driving a long
                    distance to
                    pick up your orders (they deliver) no sorting out into individual orders ( they do that ). We have
                    worked
                    with Stevco for almost 10 years and have had no mistakes on what he have ordered (which is a miracle
                    if
                    you
                    have ever seen some of the writing on kids order forms) Best of all Ernie & Anita are just so easy
                    to
                    work
                    with, easy to communicate with and a pleasure to work with.

                    They are an excellent company to work with. Quick communication and always willing to go the extra
                    mile
                    to
                    make things right. This has been my third year being involved in our fundraiser and they have been
                    amazing.

                    It was much easier to do than I thought. I would really like to have an online option to have people
                    buy
                    items and I think we could have raised more money. Using paper seems to be the hardest part.
